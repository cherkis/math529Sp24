/-!
**The Schröder–Bernstein Theorem**:
Given injections f : α → β and g : β → α,
we construct a bijection h : α ↔ β.

**The construction**:
  A₀ = α \ range(g)    (elements of α not in the image of g)
  Aₙ₊₁ = (g ∘ f) '' Aₙ  (apply g ∘ f to the previous layer)
  A = ⋃ₙ Aₙ             (the union of all layers)

Then define:
  h(x) = f(x)        if x ∈ A
  h(x) = g⁻¹(x)     if x ∉ A

In Homework 6 you proved that h is well-defined (g⁻¹(x) exists when x ∉ A).
Now, you will prove that h is *bijective*.

#check problem2 -- (f : α → β) (g : β → α) (hg : Function.Injective g) (x : α) : x ∉ A → g (h x) = x

/- Injectivity splits into (essentially) three cases:
Suppose h(a) = h(a').

Case 1: a,a' ∈ A, then (since on A h = f) we have
   f(a) = h(a) = h(a') = f(a'), so a = a' by injectivity of f.
Case 2: a,a' ∉ A, then (since on Aᶜ h=g⁻¹) we have
   a = g(h(a)) = g(h(a')) = a'.
Case 3: a ∈ A, a' ∉ A (or vice versa)
  Let b = h(a) = h(a').
  Then b = h(a) = f(a), and g(b) = g(h(a')) = a', so b = f(a) and g(b) = a',
    contradicting `lemma distinct`.
