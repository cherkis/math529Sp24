-- ## Integers as a quotient
-- Define an equivalence relation on pairs of natural numbers.

def CongZ (p q : ℕ × ℕ) : Prop := p.1 + q.2 = q.1 + p.2

-- Prove this is an equivalence relation,
-- by proving reflexivity,

  sorry
  done

-- symmetry,
@[autogradedProof 5]
theorem problem2 : CongZ p q → CongZ q p := by
  sorry
  done

-- and transitivity.

  sorry

-- These assemple into a theorem
theorem congZ_equiv : Equivalence CongZ where
  refl := problem1
  symm := problem2
  trans := problem3

-- and provide a `Setoid` instance.
instance congZSetoid: Setoid (ℕ × ℕ) where
  r := CongZ
  iseqv := congZ_equiv

-- and use this Setoid instance to define our custom integer type as a quotient type!
abbrev newZ := Quotient congZSetoid

-- Consider a few integers as elements of `newZ`:
def negOne : newZ := Quotient.mk congZSetoid (1, 2)
def negOne' : newZ := Quotient.mk congZSetoid (2, 3)
def negTwo : newZ := Quotient.mk congZSetoid (1, 3)
def negTwo' : newZ := Quotient.mk congZSetoid (5, 7)

-- Prove that 1/2 = 2/4

-- Prove that 1/2 ≠ 1/3

-- Prove that the absolute value is well-defined on the quotient.
def newAbs (p : ℕ × ℕ) : ℕ := if p.1 ≥ p.2 then p.1 - p.2 else p.2 - p.1

-- To show this is well-defined, we need to show that if p and q are CongZ, then newAbs p = newAbs q.

#check Quotient.sound -- Quotient.sound : a ≈ b → ⟦a⟧ = ⟦b⟧
#check Quotient.lift -- Quotient.lift (f : α → β) : (∀ (a b : α), a ≈ b → f a = f b) → Quotient s → β
-- Quotient.lift.{u, v} {α : Sort u} {β : Sort v} {s : Setoid α} (f : α → β) : (∀ (a b : α), a ≈ b → f a = f b) → Quotient s → β

-- Then we can use `Quotient.liftOn` to define a function on `newZ` that computes the absolute value.
